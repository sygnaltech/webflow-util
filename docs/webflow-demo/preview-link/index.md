Enables you to dynamically construct a Webflow preview link to the current page.

## What is a Preview Link?

In Webflow, a 
[preview link](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/share-your-project-and-invite-collaborators)
is a special link that allows someone to view a read-only version of your Webflow site in the designer.

## What would you Use this for?

If you develop Webflow sites, and want to make it easy for someone to click a button that switches the current page into a design mode view, this utility enables that.

## How to Use it

- You must have created a preview link to your site, and extract the preview link Id. It looks something like this- `4d388483d99c6cc36c58ae966e92c615`.

Limitations;

- Does not work with Collection pages, since they require an additional collection item ID that is not emitted into the page.

## Implementation

- Add this script

```
<script type="module" src="{{ site.liburl }}/src/nocode/webflow-demo.js"></script>
```

- Add any links in the page, that you want to point to the designer view.

- Set the href to the default designer link generated by Webflow.

- Add a custom attribute of `wfu-demo-link=preview`


Best practices;

- Put in the site-level configuration so that it appears on all pages. Then you can choose which pages actually utilize it.

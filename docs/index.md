# What is WFU?

This library is a collection of utilities that add capability to 
[Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
sites. It focuses on overcoming certain limitations of Webflow, and adding certain functionality.

Some of the most popular features include;

- Data-binding form INPUT and SELECT elements to your collection lists
- Adding custom attributes dynamically to elements within a collection list.
- Adding tables support, with data sourced from Google Sheets
- Multilingual support through language-detection and a dynamic content-switcher

All of these features are focused on creating as much capability within Webflow as possible, without relying on 3rd party plug-ins and monthly service fees.

This project is also a practical exploration into the use of Javascript ES6 modules, NPM, and other state-of-the art web dev technologies, and how they can be used to enhance Webflow sites.

*This library will be expanded as needed, and broken into modules for convenient selection of the parts you need.*

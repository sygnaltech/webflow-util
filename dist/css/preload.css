/**
 * Preload
 * 
 * Preload is an attribute that is used to hide elements until they are data-bound. 
 * This is useful for hiding elements that are being loaded from a CMS or other 
 * data source. 
 * 
 * The attribute can be set to "hidden" or "invisible".
 * It is removed after data-binding to make the element visible. 

 * Usage: 
 * 
 * <div>No pre-loader, visible</div>
 * <div wfu-preload="hidden">This will be hidden until data-bound</div>
 * <div wfu-preload="invisible">This will be invisible until data-bound</div>
